# Weather-Dashboard

This app will allow the user to enter the name of a city into an input box and then press the search button. Once the search button is pressed a call will be made to 2 API's that will pull back data and populate the page with data with weather information about the city input into the input box. Once the Search button is pressed, a button will appear below the input box with the name of the city just input into the search input box, which allows the user to click it at a later time to bring all the data back up again without having to re-enter it into the search input box.

The information presented will be the current days weather including date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index.  An icon representing the current days weather will also be presented. In addition, a 5 day forecast will also be presented with data including the date, temperature, and humidity, as well as an icon representing the weather forecast for those days.

Once a city has been searched for, it will be saved to localstorage. If the user closes the page and comes back later, all the data and buttons will be reloaded back onto the page, with the last city searched data appearing on the page.
